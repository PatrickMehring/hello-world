Aloha, this is Patrick 2.0
I am approaching the end of the career I have had as a restaurant owner for the last 25 years.  My base is in Hawaii, but for the last 18 months I have become more of a nomad, living for several months at a time in locations all over the globe.  I intend to continue this life style, and would like to work on something that can provide me an additional revenue stream and allow me to work with young minded people improving the world.
